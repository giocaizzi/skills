# Agents Skills

This is my personal set of skills for AI Agents. 

## Usage

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone giocaizzi/skills
# navigate to the repository
cd skills
# copy the specific skill folder you want to use into your agent's `skills` folder
cp -r skills/<skill_name> /path/to/your/agent/skills/
```
